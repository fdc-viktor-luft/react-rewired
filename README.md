# react-rewired

Wire your react app as easy as possible

- A good alternative to react-redux
- Feels more like react (using internal react state as base model)
- flow typed out of the box
- very small package size (1.4 kB gzipped)
- high performant (statistics in comparison to react-redux will follow)
